🍂 herbst

A cozy, pastel-minimal homelab dashboard.
No database. Just TOML, a tiny Go backend, and soft autumn vibes.

> [!WARNING]
> herbst is in active development — expect bugs, missing features, and occasional UI teleportation.

## Current State

![Current UI](/docs/images/image.png)
Clean pastel-rounded service bubbles, status bars, minimal header, and a tiny powered-by footer.
